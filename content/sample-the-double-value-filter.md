I always use the same workflow to write articles for the Gestalt Garden: a list of steps I follow in order to go from "having an idea" to "having a published article."

The first step in my workflow used to be defining the goal of the article---what I wanted to achieve by writing it. Setting a goal helps me stay motivated to finish the piece and, most importantly, stay focused (by knowing what to include and what to leave out).

A few months ago, I read the book _A System For Writing_ by Bob Doto. In it, he describes a similar practice. However, Bob Doto defines not one, but two goals: one "for himself" and one "for his readers". The idea is to make each article a win-win---beneficial both for the writer and the audience.

I really liked that approach. After processing it through my Zettelkasten, I created my own version of this tool and added it to my workflow. So now, instead of defining just one goal, I define two. Here's the final version of the tool:

  > [!NOTE]
  > **Tool — The double-value filter**
  > 
  > Before you start writing an article, answer these questions _honestly_:
  > 
  >   1. What do I gain (personally or professionally) from writing this article?
  >   2. Who does this article help, and how does it improve their situation?
  > 
  > If both values---yours and the reader's---are clear and well-defined, go ahead with the article. If not, either archive or rethink it until they are.

Here's an example of how I applied this tool to the note you're reading right now:

  > [!NOTE]
  > **Example**
  > 
  > **What do I gain (personally or professionally) from writing this article?**
  > I’m testing whether my new system for publishing notes as part of my newsletter works or not.
  > 
  > **Who does this article help, and how does it improve their situation?**
  > This article invites the reader to reflect on their creative workflow and how to consciously integrate tools to improve it.

If you like this tool, I recommend adding it to your own workflow to make sure you use it consistently.

**PS:** Writing this note was a _win_ for me. Then, the question is... was it a _win_ for you too? Let me know in the comments :-)
